***********************************************************

This is a shopping cart created with PHP and Javascript. 
The checkout process is incomplete as it requires you
to hook into whatever API you will use for payments.
PayPal's sandbox is already set up but will have to be changed.
I originally intented to set up payment api's for credit cards 
using Authorize.Net, Google Pay, Amazon Pay and Paypal. But if you
want to use this as a very basic starting point, it is pretty easy
to customize.

The SQL file is included.
